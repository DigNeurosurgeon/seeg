Stereoencephalography (SEEG) is a technique used in drug-resistant epilepsy patients that may be a candidate for surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone. Multiple electrodes are placed using a so-called "frame based" stereotactic approach, in our case using the [Leksell frame](https://www.elekta.com/neurosurgery/leksell-stereotactic-system/). In our previous paper "[Methodology, outcome, safety and in vivo accuracy in traditional frame-based stereoelectroencephalography](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28676892)" by Van der Loo et al (2017) we reported on SEEG electrode implantation accuracy in a cohort of 71 patients who were operated between September 2008 and April 2016. This resulted in a dataset of 902 electrodes. 

The goal of the current project is to use a public version of this dataset (without any personal identifiers) to predict implantation accuracy by using and comparing different machine learning approaches.
